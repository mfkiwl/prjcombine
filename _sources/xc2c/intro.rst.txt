Introduction
############

Coolrunner II is a family of flash-based 1.8V CPLDs manufactured by Xilinx.
It is a derivative of both the XC9500 family and the XPLA3 family.


Devices
=======

The following devices exist:

.. include:: gen-devices.inc

The parts starting with XA are automotive versions.  They are functionally completely identical to corresponding XC versions.

The parts with names ending with A are revisions of the original design, and are
fully backwards compatible with them (including bitstream backwards compatibility).
Thus, eg. XC2C32A can always be used in place of an XC2C32.


Packages
========

The devices come in the following packages:

- PLCC:

  - PC44 (JEDEC MO-047)

- QFN:

  - QF32
  - QF48

- QFP:

  - very thin QFP (1mm thickness):

    - VQ44 (0.8mm pitch; JEDEC MS-026-ACB)
    - VQ100 (0.5mm pitch; JEDEC MS-026-AED)

  - thin QFP (1.4mm thickness):

    - TQ144 (0.5mm pitch; JEDEC MS-026-BFB)

  - plastic QFP:
  
    - PQ208 (3.4mm thickness, 0.5mm pitch; JEDEC MS-029-FA-1)

- BGA:

  - fine-pitch BGA (1mm pitch):

    - FG324

  - thin fine-pitch BGA (1mm pitch):

    - FT256

  - chip-scale BGA (0.5mm pitch):

    - CP56
    - CP132

  - ???

Pin compatibility is maintained across devices within a single package.


Device pins
===========

The Coolrunner-II devices have the following pins:

- ``GND``: ground pins
- ``VCCINT``: core power, has to be 1.8V
- ``VCCIO{bank}``: I/O power, has to be 1.5V, 1.8.V, 2.5V, or 3.3V
- ``VCCAUX``: I/O power for dedicated JTAG pins

- ``FB{i}_MC{j}``: general purpose I/O, associated with a macrocell; some of them also have an associated
  special function that can be used in addition to or instead of their plain I/O function:

  - ``GCLK[0-2]``: capable of driving ``FCLK*`` fast clock networks
  - ``GSR``: capable of driving ``FSR`` fast set/reset network
  - ``GOE[0-3]``: capable of driving ``FOE*`` fast output enable networks
  - ``DGE`` (on larger devices): capable of driving the ``DGE`` global network,
    controlling optional latched on all input buffers in the device
  - ``CDRST`` (on larger devices): used as clock divider reset when the clock divider is in use

  The output drivers are powered by the ``VCCIO`` rails, and the output voltage
  is determined by that rail.

  On larger devices, all I/O pads are also configurable as VREF pins for use with VREF-based
  I/O standards.  Curiously, VREF pins are not preassigned, but can be mostly-arbitrarily
  designated by the designer, subject to some constraints.  The VREF rails are per-bank.

- ``IPAD0``: general purpose input, without an associated macrocell; present only on
  the XC2C32 and its variants (in the quantity of one)

- ``TCK``, ``TMS``, ``TDI``, ``TDO``: dedicated JTAG pins; the ``TDO`` pin output driver
  is powered by the ``VCCAUX`` rail
