Block RAM
#########

The ``BRAM`` tile contains one bel, the block RAM. It corresponds to four vertically stacked interconnect tiles. The ``BRAM`` bel is a significantly improved version of the Virtex 2 block RAM, introducing:

- optional data output pipeline registers
- hardware ECC encoder and decoder (with error correction)
- per-byte write enable
- cascade capability, for chaining two vertically adjacent BRAMs into one 32768×1 RAM
- independent read and write width for a port
- hardware FIFO controller

The ``BRAM`` bel can be used in three ways:

- plain RAM mode, corresponding to ``RAMB16`` library primitive
- ECC RAM mode, corresponding to ``RAMB32_S64_ECC`` library primitive; this requires a pair of ``BRAM`` tiles, aligned to a multiple of 8 rows
- FIFO mode, corresponding to ``FIFO16`` library primitive

The bel has the following inputs connected via general interconnect: 

- ``CLK[AB]`` (freely invertible through the interconnect): clocks for port A and port B
- ``EN[AB]`` (freely invertible through the interconnect): enable for port A and port B
- ``SSR[AB]`` (freely invertible through the interconnect): synchronous set/reset for the read ports
- ``REGCE[AB]`` (freely invertible through the interconnect): pipeline register clock enable for read ports
- ``WE[AB][0-3]`` (freely invertible through the bel): per-byte write enable for port A and port B
- ``ADDR[AB]0`` through ``ADDR[AB]14``, the address buses for port A and port B; ``ADDR[AB]14`` is used only for cascade mode, and must be tied high otherwise
- ``DI[AB]0`` through ``DI[AB]31``: the main data input for port A and port B
- ``DIP[AB]0`` through ``DIP[AB]3``: the parity data input for port A and port B

The bel has the following output pins connected via general interconnect:

- ``DO[AB]0`` through ``DO[AB]31``: the main data output for port A and port B
- ``DOP[AB]0`` through ``DOP[AB]3``: the parity data output for port A and port B

The bel also has special pins routed through dedicated interconnect:

- ``CASCADEOUT[AB]``: cascade outputs, used to implement the cascade function
- ``CASCADEIN[AB]``: cascade inputs, connected to the ``CASCADEOUT[AB]`` pins of the BRAM in the tile immediately below

The cascade is not routed across PowerPC holes — cascade functionality cannot be used between BRAMs on two sides of the PowerPC hole.

The attributes of the ``BRAM`` bel are:

- ``MODE``: selects the operating mode of the bel

  - ``RAM``: implements a RAM
  - ``FIFO``: implements a FIFO

- ``WE[AB][0-3]INV``: when set, the corresponding pin is inverted
- ``EN_ECC_READ`` (4-bit value) and ``EN_ECC_WRITE`` (4-bit value): must all be set when in ECC mode, exact workings unknown
- ``READ_WIDTH_[AB]`` selects the read width of the given port; the values are:

  - ``1``: ``DO[AB]0`` is used for data, ``ADDR[AB][0-14]`` is used for address
  - ``2``: ``DO[AB][01]`` is used for data, ``ADDR[AB][1-14]`` is used for address
  - ``4``: ``DO[AB][0-3]`` is used for data, ``ADDR[AB][2-14]`` is used for address
  - ``9``: ``DO[AB][0-7]`` and ``DOP[AB]0`` are used for data, ``ADDR[AB][3-14]`` is used for address
  - ``18``: ``DO[AB][0-15]`` and ``DOP[AB][01]`` are used for data, ``ADDR[AB][4-14]`` is used for address
  - ``36``: ``DO[AB][0-31]`` and ``DOP[AB][0-3]`` are used for data, ``ADDR[AB][5-14]`` is used for address

- ``WRITE_WIDTH_[AB]`` selects the write width of the given port; the values are:

  - ``1``: ``DI[AB]0`` is used for data, ``ADDR[AB][0-14]`` is used for address
  - ``2``: ``DI[AB][01]`` is used for data, ``ADDR[AB][1-14]`` is used for address
  - ``4``: ``DI[AB][0-3]`` is used for data, ``ADDR[AB][2-14]`` is used for address
  - ``9``: ``DI[AB][0-7]`` and ``DIP[AB]0`` are used for data, ``ADDR[AB][3-14]`` is used for address
  - ``18``: ``DI[AB][0-15]`` and ``DIP[AB][01]`` are used for data, ``ADDR[AB][4-14]`` is used for address
  - ``36``: ``DI[AB][0-31]`` and ``DIP[AB][0-3]`` are used for data, ``ADDR[AB][5-14]`` is used for address

- ``FIFO_WIDTH``: selects the data width when in FIFO mode; must be equal to ``READ_WIDTH_A`` and ``WRITE_WIDTH_B``

- ``WRITE_MODE_[AB]``: selects behavior of the read port when writing, the values are:

  - ``WRITE_FIRST``: data output shows just-written data
  - ``READ_FIRST``: data output shows data previously in memory at the given address
  - ``NO_CHANGE``: the data output is unchanged from previous cycle

  Both of these attributes must be set to ``WRITE_FIRST`` in FIFO mode.

- ``SRVAL_[AB]`` (36-bit value): selects the set/reset value of the read port; the low 32 bits correspond to ``DO[AB][0-31]`` while the high 4 bits correspond to ``DOP[AB][0-3]``
- ``INIT_[AB]`` (36-bit value): selects the initial value of the read port; the low 32 bits correspond to ``DO[AB][0-31]`` while the high 4 bits correspond to ``DOP[AB][0-3]``
- ``DO[AB]_REG`` : selects number of pipeline registers for read port

  - ``0``: no pipeline registers, just output latches; same behavior as older FPGAs
  - ``1``: one additional pipeline register on the read port

  Both of these attributes must be set to ``WRITE_FIRST`` in FIFO mode.

- ``RAM_EXTENSION_[AB]``: controls the cascade mode for the given port

  - ``NONE_UPPER``: the port is not in cascade mode, or it is the upper BRAM in cascade mode

    - when ``ADDR[AB]14`` is high, data is written to BRAM and/or read from BRAM
    - when ``ADDR[AB]14`` is low, data is not written to BRAM; read data is forwarded from ``CASCADEIN[AB]``

    If the BRAM is not part of cascade, ``ADDR[AB]14`` should be tied high.

  - ``LOWER``: the port is the lower BRAM in cascade mode

    - when ``ADDR[AB]14`` is high, data is not written to BRAM
    - when ``ADDR[AB]14`` is low, data is written to BRAM

- ``INVERT_CLK_DO[AB]_REG``: if set, the clock controlling the pipeline register is inverted from ``CLK[AB]``
- ``DATA`` (16384-bit value): the initial data for the BRAM main plane; corresponds to concatenation of ``INIT_xx`` primitive attributes
- ``DATAP`` (2048-bit value): the initial data for the BRAM parity plane; corresponds to concatenation of ``INITP_xx`` primitive attributes
- ``SAVEDATA`` (64-bit value): if set, the BRAM data will not be written during partial reconfiguration; the attribute has one bit per frame of the bitstream BRAM data tile
- ``FIRST_WORD_FALL_THROUGH``: like the corresponding ``FIFO16`` attribute
- ``ALMOST_FULL_OFFSET`` (12-bit value): like the corresponding ``FIFO16`` attribute
- ``ALMOST_EMPTY_OFFSET`` (12-bit value): like the corresponding ``FIFO16`` attribute, except the bitstream value is:

  - 1 smaller then primitive attribute when not in FWFT mode
  - 2 smaller then primitive attribute when in FWFT mode

- ``WW_VALUE``: unknown purpose, must be set to ``NONE``

ECC mode
========

To use the ECC mode an implement a ``RAMB32_S64_ECC`` primitive, do the following:

- pick a pair of aligned adjacent BRAM tiles (the lower one having bottom row index divisible by 8)
- use the ``A`` port for reading, ``B`` port for writing
- connect ``CLK[AB]``, ``EN[AB]``, ``ADDR[AB]`` appropriately, mirroring them across both BRAMs
- tie ``WEA*`` low, ``WEB*`` high
- tie ``REGCEA`` high
- tie ``SSR[AB]`` low
- set ``DOA_REG`` appropriately
- set ``EN_ECC_READ`` and ``EN_ECC_WRITE`` to all-1
- set ``READ_WIDTH_[AB]`` and ``WRITE_WIDTH_[AB]`` to ``36``
- connect ``DI`` and ``DO`` of the primitive as follows:

  - bits 0-13 to lower ``D{IB|OA}[0-13]``
  - bit 14 to lower ``D{IB|OA}P1``
  - bit 15 to lower ``D{IB|OA}P3``
  - bits 16-29 to lower ``D{IB|OA}[16-19]``
  - bit 30 to lower ``D{IB|OA}P0``
  - bit 31 to lower ``D{IB|OA}P2``
  - bits 32-45 to upper ``D{IB|OA}[0-13]``
  - bit 46 to upper ``D{IB|OA}P1``
  - bit 47 to upper ``D{IB|OA}P3``
  - bits 48-61 to upper ``D{IB|OA}[16-19]``
  - bit 62 to upper ``D{IB|OA}P0``
  - bit 63 to upper ``D{IB|OA}P2``

- connect ``STATUS[0]`` of the primitive to lower ``DOA31``
- connect ``STATUS[0]`` of the primitive to upper ``DOA0``

Bitstream
=========

The data for a BRAM is spread across 5 bitstream tiles:

- tiles 0-3: the 4 bitstream tiles that are shared with the ``INT`` interconnect tiles (starting from the bottom)
- tile 4: the dedicated BRAM data tile located in the BRAM data area; this tile is 64×320 bits; it contains solely the ``DATA`` and ``DATAP`` attributes and the ``SAVEDATA`` attribute
