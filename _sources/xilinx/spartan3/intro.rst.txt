Introduction
############

Spartan 3 is a family of SRAM-based FPGAs, based on a cut-down version of :ref:`Virtex 2 <virtex2>`.

There are several kinds of Spartan 3 FPGAs:

- Spartan 3, the base version
- Spartan 3E, an updated version of Spartan 3, with higher logic-to-IO ratio
- Spartan 3A, an updated version of Spartan 3E
- Spartan 3AN, non-volatile version of Spartan 3A; it is literally Spartan 3A and stock SPI flash in a trenchcoat, with the FPGA die being exactly identical to Spartan 3A
- Spartan 3A DSP, an updated version of Spartan 3A with added hard DSP blocks

The base Spartan 3 FPGAs feature:

- a :ref:`general interconnect structure <spartan3-interconnect>` derived from Virtex 2
- a dedicated :ref:`clock interconnect <spartan3-clock>` with 8 global clocks and ``BUFGMUX`` primitives with clock multiplexing
- :ref:`configurable logic blocks <spartan3-clb>`, derived from the Virtex 2 ones
- :ref:`block RAM tiles <spartan3-bram>`, essentially identical to Virtex 2, containing:

  - 18-kbit block RAM
  - 18Ã—18 multiplier blocks

- :ref:`input-output tiles <spartan3-io>`, similar to Virtex 2
- :ref:`digital clock managers <spartan3-dcm-s3>`, essentially identical to Virtex 2
- :ref:`corner tiles <spartan3-corner>`, with various global bits of logic:

  - ``BSCAN`` primitive, allowing access to FPGA fabric via dedicated JTAG instructions
  - ``STARTUP`` primitive, controlling the startup process
  - ``CAPTURE`` primitive, for user-triggered FF state capture
  - ``ICAP`` primitive, allowing access to the internal configuration port
  - ``PMV`` primitive, an internal oscillator used for configuration
  - per-IO bank:

    - DCI control blocks
    - LVDS bias generators

Spartan 3E brings the following changes:

- improved clock interconnect, with 24 global clock buffers that can be multiplexed to 8 clocks per region
- improved hard multiplier blocks, with pipeline registers
- :ref:`a new version of DCM <spartan3-dcm-s3e>`
- IO tile changes

  - new set of IO standards supported
  - improved DDR registers
  - removed DCI support
  - 4 banks per device, instead of 8

- a new bit of :ref:`hard PCI logic <spartan3-pcilogicse>`
- support for SPI and BPI configuration modes

Spartan 3A brings the following changes:

- improved block RAM, with per-byte write enables
- IO tile changes

  - new set of IO standards supported
  - improved DDR registers
  - the IO banks are now specialized (top and bottom banks have differential termination support, left and right banks have higher drive strength)

- more singleton special primitives in the corners:

  - ``DNA_PORT`` allows access to unique per-device identifier
  - ``SPI_ACCESS`` allows access to the SPI flash included in-package on Spartan 3AN devices

Spartan 3A DSP brings the following changes:

- improved block RAM, with pipeline registers and asynchronous reset
- the hard multiplier blocks are removed and replaced with :ref:`a new DSP block <spartan3-dsp>`
