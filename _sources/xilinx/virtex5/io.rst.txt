I/O banks and special functions
===============================

Virtex 5 devices have up to three I/O columns:

- the left I/O column, containing only IO tiles; if the device has no transceivers on the left side, it is the leftmost column of the device; otherwise, it is somewhat to the right of the left GT column; it is always present
- the center column, part of which contains IO tiles; the IO tiles in this column come in up to four segments:

  - the lower segment (variable size, not present on all devices), between the bottom edge of the device and the lower CMTs
  - the lower middle segment (always 20 tiles high), between lower CMTs and the configuration center
  - the upper middle segment (always 20 tiles high), between the configuration center and the upper CMTs
  - the upper segment (variable size, not present on all devices), between the device and the upper CMTs and the top edge of the device

- the right I/O column, containing only IO tiles; it is present on all devices except for ``xc5vlx20t``; if present, it is somewhat to the left of the device's right edge

Virtex 5 has the following banks:

- bank 0 is the configuration bank; it contains only dedicated configuration I/O pins, as follows:

  - ``CCLK``
  - ``CS_B``
  - ``DONE``
  - ``D_OUT_BUSY``
  - ``D_IN``
  - ``HSWAPEN``
  - ``INIT``
  - ``M0``
  - ``M1``
  - ``M2``
  - ``PROGRAM_B``
  - ``RDWR_B``
  - ``TCK``
  - ``TDI``
  - ``TDO``
  - ``TMS``

  bank 0 is not associated with any IO tiles

- banks 1-4: middle segments of the center column; each of them consists of 10 IO tiles; they contain global clock inputs and shared configuration pins

  - bank 1: immediately above configuration center
  - bank 2: immediately below configuration center
  - bank 3: above bank 1, below upper CMTs (not present on ``xc5vlx20t``)
  - bank 4: below bank 2, above lower CMTs

- banks 5-10: lower and upper segments of the center column; each of them consists of 20 IO tiles

  - banks 5, 7, 9 are the upper segment, with bank 5 being immediately above upper CMTs; bank number increases upwards
  - banks 6, 8, 10 are the lower segment, with bank 6 being immediately below lower CMTs; bank number increases downwards

- banks 11 and up: left and right column; each of them consists of 20 IO tiles

  - banks 11, 15, 19, 23, ...: left column, above the configuration center; bank number increases upwards, starting from bank 11 immediately above the configuration center row
  - banks 12, 16, 20, 24, ...: right column, above the configuration center; bank number increases upwards, starting from bank 12 immediately above the configuration center row
  - banks 13, 17, 21, 25, ...: left column, below the configuration center; bank number increases downwards, starting from bank 13 immediately below the configuration center row
  - banks 14, 18, 22, 26, ...: right column, below the configuration center; bank number increases downwards, starting from bank 14 immediately below the configuration center row

All IOBs in the device are grouped into differential pairs, one pair per IO tile.  ``IOB1`` is the "true" pin of the pair, while ``IOB0`` is the "complemented" pin.  Differential input and true differential output is supported on all pins of the device.

``IOB1`` pads in the 4 rows surronding the HCLK row (that is, in rows 8-11 of every clock region) are considered "clock-capable". They can drive ``BUFIO`` and ``BUFR`` buffers via dedicated connections. While Xilinx documentation also considers ``IOB0`` pads clock-capable, this only means that they can be used together with ``IOB1`` as a differential pair.

The ``IOB1`` pads in banks 3 and 4 are considered "global clock-capable". They can drive ``BUFGCTRL`` buffers and CMT primitives via dedicated connections.  Likewise, Xilinx considers ``IOB0`` pads to be clock-capable, but they can only drive clocks as part of differential pair with ``IOB1``.

The ``IOB0`` in rows 5 and 15 of every region is capable of being used as a VREF pad.

Each bank except for banks 1 and 2 has two IOBs that can be used for reference resistors in DCI operation. They are both located in the same I/O tile, with VRP located on ``IOB0`` and VRN located on ``IOB1``. The relevant tile is located as follows:

- bank 1 and 2: VRP/VRN are not present in this bank (DCI can still be used by cascade from banks 3 and 4)
- bank 3: row 7 of the bank (or row 7 of the region)
- bank 4: row 2 of the bank (or row 12 of the region)
- banks 5 and up: row 7 of the bank (or row 7 of the region)

In parallel configuration modes, some I/O pads in banks 1-4 are borrowed for configuration use, as the parallel data pins:

The ``SYSMON`` present on the device can use up to 16 IOB pairs from the left I/O column as auxiliary analog differential inputs. The ``VPx`` input corresponds to ``IOB1`` and ``VNx`` corresponds to ``IOB0`` within the same tile. The IOBs are in the following tiles, where ``r`` is the configuration center row:

- ``VP0/VN0``: left I/O column, row ``r - 10``
- ``VP1/VN1``: left I/O column, row ``r - 9``
- ``VP2/VN2``: left I/O column, row ``r - 8``
- ``VP3/VN3``: left I/O column, row ``r - 7``
- ``VP4/VN4``: left I/O column, row ``r - 6``
- ``VP5/VN5``: left I/O column, row ``r - 4``
- ``VP6/VN6``: left I/O column, row ``r - 3``
- ``VP7/VN7``: left I/O column, row ``r - 2``
- ``VP8/VN8``: left I/O column, row ``r - 1``
- ``VP9/VN9``: left I/O column, row ``r``
- ``VP10/VN10``: left I/O column, row ``r + 1``
- ``VP11/VN11``: left I/O column, row ``r + 2``
