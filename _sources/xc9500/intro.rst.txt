Introduction
############

XC9500 is a family of flash-based CPLDs manufactured by Xilinx.  It is a derivative of the earlier XC7200 and XC7300
EPLD families.  It comes in three variants:

1. XC9500: 5V core logic, 3.3V or 5V I/O, original version.
2. XC9500XL: 3.3V core logic, 2.5V or 3.3V I/O (5V tolerant), with some functional changes from XC9500:

   - UIM no longer has wired-AND functionality
   - FFs have clock enable function
   - 54 (instead of 36) UIM inputs per function block
   - FF has configurable clock polarity
   - FOE/FCLK multiplexers and inversion have been removed
   - optional weak bus keeper can be configured for all pins

3. XC9500XV: 2.5V core logic, 1.8V, 2.5V, or 3.3V I/O, with minor functional changes from XC9500XL:

   - larger devices have two I/O banks with separate VCCIO
   - the bitstream now contains a ``DONE`` bit tied to ``ISC_DONE``, preventing problems with partially configured devices

Pin compatibility is maintained across all 3 variants of the XC9500 family within a single package.
Additionally, devices in PQ208 and HQ208 packages are pin compatible with each other.
