Introduction
############

XC9500 is a family of flash-based CPLDs manufactured by Xilinx.  It is a derivative of the earlier XC7200 and XC7300
EPLD families.  It comes in three variants:

1. XC9500: 5V core logic, 3.3V or 5V I/O, original version.
2. XC9500XL: 3.3V core logic, 2.5V or 3.3V I/O (5V tolerant), with some functional changes from XC9500:

   - UIM no longer has wired-AND functionality
   - FFs have clock enable function
   - 54 (instead of 36) UIM inputs per function block
   - FF has configurable clock polarity
   - output enable has configurable polarity
   - FOE/FCLK multiplexers and inversion have been removed
   - optional weak bus keeper can be configured for all pins

3. XC9500XV: 2.5V core logic, 1.8V, 2.5V, or 3.3V I/O, with minor functional changes from XC9500XL:

   - larger devices have two or four I/O banks with separate VCCIO
   - the bitstream now contains a ``DONE`` bit tied to ``ISC_DONE``, preventing problems with partially configured devices

Pin compatibility is maintained across all 3 variants of the XC9500 family within a single package.
Additionally, devices in PQ208 and HQ208 packages are pin compatible with each other.


Device pins
===========

The XC9500 family devices have the following pads:

- ``GND``: ground pins
- ``VCCINT``: core power, has to be:

  - 5V on XC9500
  - 3.3V on XC9500XL
  - 2.5V on XC9500XV

- ``VCCIO`` or ``VCCIO{bank}``: I/O power, has to be:

  - 3.3V or 5V on XC9500
  - 2.5V or 3.3V on XC9500XL
  - 1.8V, 2.5V, or 3.3V on XC9500XV

- ``FB{i}_MC{j}``: general purpose I/O, associated with a macrocell; some of them also have an associated
  special function that can be used in addition to or instead of their plain I/O function:

  - ``GCLK[0-2]``: capable of driving ``FCLK*`` fast clock networks
  - ``GSR``: capable of driving ``FSR`` fast set/reset network
  - ``GOE[0-1]`` (smaller devices) or ``GOE[0-3]`` (larger devices): capable of driving ``FOE*`` fast output enable networks

  Curiously, the ``GOE`` specials mapping to device pads varies with packaging on XC9572* devices.
  How exactly that works is unknown.

  The output drivers are powered by the ``VCCIO`` rails, and the output voltage
  is determined by that rail.

  For input, the following voltages are supported on all pins, regardless of VCCIO voltage:

  - XC9500: 3.3V or 5V
  - XC9500XL: 2.5V or 3.3V
  - XC9500XV: 2.5V or 3.3V (notably, 1.8V is not supported)

- ``TCK``, ``TMS``, ``TDI``, ``TDO``: dedicated JTAG pins; the ``TDO`` pin output driver
  is powered by one of the ``VCCIO`` rails
