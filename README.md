# Project Combine

An FPGA reverse engineering project.

The goals of this project are:

- providing a deduplicated geometry database for target devices
  - types and locations of all logical primitives within the device
  - geometry of all interconnect wires
  - interconnection points between the wires
  - package pinouts
- providing a timing database for target devices
  - combinational and sequential timings of logical primitives
  - interconnect parameters and timing formulas
- providing a bitstream format database for target devices
  - the location and semantics of all configuration bits
- making all of the above available both for use by external programs and as human-readable documentation
- providing Rust libraries for loading and operating on the above databases
- documenting the behavior of target devices and their logical primitives

The target devices currently include:

- all SiliconBlue FPGAs
- all Xilinx FPGAs
- some Lattice FPGAs:
  - SCM
  - ECP, XP, MachXO
  - ECP2, ECP2M, XP2
  - ECP3
  - MachXO2, MachXO3
  - ECP4
  - ECP5
  - Crosslink
- all Xilinx CPLDs

More targets are expected to be added in the future.

## Roadmap

For each of the supported device families:

- phase 1: geometry database extraction
- phase 2: bitstream reverse engineering
- phase 3: timing database extraction
- phase 4: in-hardware test, documentation writing, final database export
